Also create a README.md within this “Week 1” folder itself.
Write your name at the start.
Give a small explanation of what you have done for both tasks. For task 1, show the plot with labelling of “loss vs % partitioned”. Report the minima. For task 2, show in a table, the classification algorithms you have tried, and the accuracy obtained over the test dataset. Report the best classifier.

TASK1:

My graph is Task1 notebook . I got highest accuracy when test_size was aroung 0.25 i.e 25% ... Its imp to note that the accuracy I was getting was very close values . so its knida difficult to show exact peak but making graph multiple times it was evedient that i am getting maxima at areund 20-30% partition .

I used RandomForest Classifier .

Task2:

## Classifiers I used and Its Accuracy :

RandomForestClassifier --> ~80% accurate
GaussianNB --> ~90% accurate
KNN --> ~70% accurate

NOTE : its not like GaussianNB is better . It depends on DATA . ForExample I got accuracy of RandomForest more than GaussianNB in Task1(I did that just for practice )

## Submission Results :
<ul>
  <li> Task 1: Correct </li>
  <li> Task 2: The gender_submission.csv is not the correct y_test, its infact not available. You should have split the data into training and test. But it's fine for now. Good Work </li>
  <li> <b>Submission Accepted</b> </li>
  <li> Unlocked Assigment 2: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aQ62-UioJ5y-aKBXhk5TutvDl7uhv-ZW/view?usp=sharing </li>
